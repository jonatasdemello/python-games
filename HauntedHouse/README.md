# HauntedHouse

HauntedHouse game in Python.

This is a port of the text adventure game in the 1983 Usborne-Hayes book Write Your Own Adventure Games For Your Microcomputer.

The book explains, for complete beginners, how the game is designed and implemented in BASIC. I recommend reading the book (it's very short and has lots of illustrations).
