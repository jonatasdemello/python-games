7110 PRINT COMM,INPTK(1),INPTK(2),INPTK(3)
7120 ARG = INPTK(2) - ITEMOFF: IF COMM <> 27 AND ARG < 1 or ARG > LASTITEM THEN D$ = "3KXK?9": GOSUB 11000: GOTO 5000

replace by
7120 ARG = ITEMOFF - INPTK(2)
or
7120 ARG = INPTK(2) - DIROFF

ITEMOFF = 33
INPTK(2) = 31 | 32 | 33

	31 LEFT
	32 CENTER
	33 RIGHT
	

Hi,
when you type "OPEN LEFT DOOR"
line 7120 calculates ARG as the second word number stored in INPTK(2) = 31 (LEFT) or 31 (CENTER) or 33 (RIGHT) 
subtracted by ITEMOFF = 33 (line 700)
which translates to: 
ARG = 31 - 33 = -2
this happens because INPTK(2) will always be lower than ITEMOFF (=33)
and it will fail on line 7130 because ILOC(ARG) translates to ILOC(-2)
and arrays can't have negative indexes.

So, in line 7120, instead of:

`7120 ARG = INPTK(2) - ITEMOFF`

if we just swith the order of the parameters (and leave the rest of the line after the : untouched)

`7120 ARG = ITEMOFF - INPTK(2)`

everything works correctly.
