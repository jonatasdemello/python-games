# UNCLE TAYS HOUSE ADVENTURE

C# version

An online orignal version can be played at:

Select "Text Adventure (Floyd McWilliams)"

Notes:

This is a simple port to C# from BASIC.
It does not use all the C# language features or any enterprise or design pattern.
The goal is to keep ot simple, so it can be ported to Python or Javascript later.


I used C# because I am more familiar with, plus testing and debugging is easier.


Because BASIC arrarys start at 1, I added a dummy -99 element to each array make the convesion easier.

`arr[0] = -99;`
