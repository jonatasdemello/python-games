Another new game from Creative Computing…

The Genesis of Wumpus

Two years ago I happened by People's  Computer Company (PCC) and saw some of
their computer games  such as Hurkle, Snark, and Mugwump. My reaction was:
"EECH!!" Each of these games was based on a 10 x 10 grid in Cartesian
co-ordinates and three of them was too much for me. I started to think along the
lines of: "There has to be a hide and seek computer  game without that (exp.
deleted) grid!!"  In fact, why not a topological computer game - Imagine a set
of points connected in some way and the player moves about the set via the
interconnections.

That afternoon in meditation the  phrase "Hunt the Wumpus" arrived, and Wumpus
was born. He's still a bit vague in physical detail as most dedicated Wumpus
hunters know, but appearances are part of the game. (If you like, send me a
picture of your version of a Wumpus. Perhaps friendly Dave,  our editor,  will
publish the best one in Creative Computing.)  The grid I chose was the vertices
of a dodecahedron - simply because it's my favorite Platonic solid and once, 
ages ago, I made a kite shaped like one. The edges became the connecting tunnels
between the caves which were the set of points for the game.

My basic idea at this time was for the player to approach the Wumpus, back off,
and come up to him by going around the dodecahedron. To my knowledge, this has
never happened... most players adopt other strategies rather than this
cold-blooded approach.

Anyway... how to get the Wumpus! How about an arrow which could turn corners as
it goes from room to room. Let the hunter tell the arrow where to go and let it
fly. The shortest round trip without reversals is 5 caves and thus the Crooked
Arrow.

Hmmm… How does one sense the Wumpus? It's dark in yonder cave, and light would
wake him up. If one got one cave away, the Wumpus's distinct smell would serve
as a warning. So far, so good…  but Wumpus is still too easy, so let's  find
some appropriate hazards for the caves.

Bottomless pits were easy. Any imaginary cave would have a few of those around
the place. Superbats were harder to come by. It took me a day or two to get that
idea. The Superbats are a sort of rapid transit system gone a little batty
(sorry about that one). They take you a random distance to a random cave and
leave you there. If that's a pit or a Wumpus, well, you are in Fate's hands.

Around this time, I saw that Map-making would be a regular activity of
Wumpus-hunters. I numbered the caves and made the scheme fixed in the hopes a
practised player might notice this and make himself a permanent map of the
caverns. (Another unrealised hope - as an exercise, make yourself such a map on
a Squashed Dodecahedron).

To start the game fairly, Wumpus, Hazards, and Hunter are located on different
points at the start of the game. Each game starts with random choices of
location, but the hunter may restart with the same set-up if he chooses. This
allows re-plays if the hunter, say, fell into a pit on the first move.

Wumpus was nearly done in my mind... ( hint to a games-writer: Have a clear
notion of your game before you

start coding it. This saves MUCH confusion.) yet I felt it was a bit dull. Once
you found the Wumpus all you had to do was shoot it. To fix this, the Wumpus was
given a little life. If you shot an arrow or moved into his cave, he woke up and
chose to move to a neighboring room or to the same room (one of 4 choices). If
you and the Wumpus were in the same room after he moved, he ATE YOU UP!!

Around here I noticed that the pits and the bats didn't affect the Wumpus. To
explain this, I added some color by making him heavy and with the legendary
sucker feet. After all, evolution works in strange ways!! If you are a Wumpus
fiend,make a version of Wumpus in which he avoids pits and superbats can carry
him only one room (with the possibility of being dumped into your cave). This
can be done by making the wumpus moving procedure a subroutine.

I wrote Wumpus and dropped it off at PCC. Then I went home and dreamed up Wumpus
II which will be covered in the next issue of Creative Computing.

The Birth of Wumpus
Around a month later, I went to the Synergy conference at Stanford, where many
of the far-out folk were gathered to share their visions of improving the world.
PCC had a few terminals running in a conference room and I dropped by. To my
vast surprise, all of the terminals were running Wumpus and scraps of paper on
the floor with scrawled numbers and lines testified that much dedicated
Wumpus-hunting was in progress. I had spawned a hit computer game!!!

Later, PCC published Wumpus in its newsletter (If you haven't seen it, write
them for a subscription: P.O. Box 310, Menlo Park, Cal. 94025), and Wumpus
appeared in all sorts of unlikely places. I have reports of Wumpus written in
RPG, a listing of one in FORTRAN, a rumor of a system command of 'to Wumpus' on
a large corporation's R&D computer system and have even seen an illustrated
version for the Hazeltine CRT terminal!!

SAMPLE RUN
INSTRUCTIONS (Y-N)?Y
WELCOME TO 'HUNT THE WUMPUS'

THE WUMPUS LIVES IN A CAVE OF 20 ROOMS: EACH ROOM HAS 3 TUNNELS LEADING TO OTHER
ROOMS. (LOOK AT A DODECAHEDRON TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A
DODECAHEDRON IS, ASK SOMEONE)

***
HAZARDS:

BOTTOMLESS PITS - TWO ROOMS HAVE BOTTOMLESS PITS IN THEM
IF YOU GO THERE: YOU FALL INTO THE PIT (& LOSE!)

SUPER BATS  - TWO OTHER ROOMS HAVE SUPER BATS. IF YOU GO THERE, A BAT GRABS YOU
AND TAKES YOU TO SOME OTHER ROOM AT RANDOM. (WHICH MIGHT BE TROUBLESOME)

WUMPUS:

THE WUMPUS IS NOT BOTHERED BY THE HAZARDS (HE HAS SUCKER FEET AND IS TOO BIG FOR
A BAT TO LIFT). USUALLY HE IS ASLEEP. TWO THINGS WAKE HIM UP: YOUR ENTERING HIS
ROOM OR YOUR SHOOTING AN ARROW.

IF THE WUMPUS WAKES, HE MOVES (P=0.75) ONE ROOM OR STAYS STILL (P=0.25). AFTER
THAT, IF HE IS WHERE YOU ARE, HE EATS YOU UP (& YOU LOSE!)

YOU:

EACH TURN YOU MAY MOVE OR SHOOT A CROOKED ARROW 
MOVING: YOU CAN GO ONE ROOM (THRU ONE TUNNEL)
ARROWS: YOU HAVE 5 ARROWS. YOU LOSE WHEN YOU RUN OUT.

EACH ARROW CAN GO FROM 1 TO 5 ROOMS: YOU AIM BY TELLING THE COMPUTER THE ROOMS
YOU WANT THE ARROW TO GO TO. IF THE ARROW CAN'T GO THAT WAY (IE NO TUNNEL) IT
MOVES AT RANDOM TO THE NEXT ROOM.

IF THE ARROW HITS THE WUMPUS: YOU WIN.

IF THE ARROW HITS YOU: YOU LOSE.

WARNINGS:

WHEN YOU ARE ONE ROOM AWAY FROM WUMPUS OP HAZARD, THE COMPUTER SAYS:

WUMPUS - 'I SMELL A WUMPUS'

BAT - 'BATS NEARBY'

PIT - 'I FEEL A DRAFT'
