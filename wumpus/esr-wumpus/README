			WUMPUS and SUPERHACK

WUMPUS is a bit of retrocomputing nostalgia.  It is an *exact* clone, even
down to the godawful user interface, of an ancient classic game.  This version
fixes two minor bugs in my original USENET posting of the source.

One historical liberty has been taken; the logo of this project is from a
latter version on the TI-99/4A with a graphical interface.

SUPERHACK is a satire, structurally quite similar to WUMPUS.
