Package: wumpus

Description: Exact clone of the ancient BASIC Hunt the Wumpus game
 WUMPUS is a bit of retrocomputing nostalgia.  It is an *exact* clone, even
 down to the godawful user interface, of an ancient classic game.  This version
 fixes two minor bugs in my original USENET posting of the source.
